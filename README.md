# Development Battle
The objective is to confront the programs developed by the participants in order to rank according to the objective achieved.

## Course of the competition
### 1- Registration (Up to 24 hours before the simulation):
All participants must be registered on the competition site in order to be able to send their program or their repositories.
### 2- Development time (About 1 months):
During this time, participants must work out their programs in order to win the competition.

They can send and test their program under development online at any time to test whether it is functional and complies with the competition protocol.
### 3-  Simulation time (About 2 days):
During this time the servers will compare all the programs of all the participants to make the classification.

The calculation time may vary depending on the number of participants and the subject of the competition.
### 4- Live broadcast of results (24h after the results of the servers):
During this time our team will be live on Twitch and / or on Youtube to comment and see the visual rendering generated by the servers.
